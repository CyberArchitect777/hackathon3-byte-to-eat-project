# Introduction

Welcome to Byte 2 Eat, a website designed to allow private users to review takeaways without having to make any public declaration. This offers a chance for highly personal reviews to be left of any standard without concerns for how it may look, legal consequences or controversy.

This website was created during Hackathon 3 of the "16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp" which ranged from 15/08/2024 (from 9am) to 19/08/2024 (up to 1.30pm) covering a weekend period. There were no planning or preparation conducted before the start day.

The goal of this Hackathon was to demonstrate the construction of a full-stack web development project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django in a team environment.
