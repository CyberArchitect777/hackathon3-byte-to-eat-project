# Introduction

Welcome to Byte 2 Eat, a website designed to allow private users to review takeaways without having to make any public declaration. This offers a chance for highly personal reviews to be left of any standard without concerns for how it may look, legal consequences or controversy.

This website was created during Hackathon 3 of the "16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp" which ranged from 15/08/2024 (from 9am) to 19/08/2024 (up to 1.30pm) covering a weekend period. There were no planning or preparation conducted before the start day.

The goal of this Hackathon was to demonstrate the construction of a full-stack web development project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django in a team environment.

## Planning methodology 

Using Agile ideals, the project was designed with the principle of minimum viable product in mind. Therefore, it was decided that a very simple product would be constructed before any additional features were added. It was determined early on that the following features would be applicable to our project. 

Must-do:

- A login and registration system for our users to sign in to their private review areas
- A review screen where comments could be added, edited or deleted.
- Additional pages for form additions to achieve this as needed.
- A site that was effortless to use in order to allow users to quickly check in and out to submit their own ideas.

Should-do: 

- A wishlist of takeaways that people might like to try.

Won't do: 

- A public facing area showing all reviewed takeaways as this is not applicable to our project idea.
- Email / reset password login as the development of this feature requires an email server and is beyond the scope of this project.
